## Summary

#### I'm an Under graduation Student from Mumbai University,

#### My background is in computer science. I am pursuing my undergrad at Mumbai University and spent a few summers learning web development and working as a web developer at startups.

#### I am a web developer with robust problem-solving skills and proven experience in creating and designing web Applications in a test-driven environment. So far I have JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python, Bootstrap, React.JS, and Git/Github under my belt.

#### I wanted to get some exposure to Open-source so I joined GSSoC as a Participant. It was a great experience. I learned a ton about application design and I got to really understand the core of ReactJS.

#### Outside of work, I've been enthusiastically grabbing onto any other programming languages, frameworks, or principles I can integrate into web coding.

#### I continue to build skills in Cloud Computing, and open-source.
